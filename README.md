# C++ Programming Language
C++ is the most used and most popular programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup. C++ is a high-level and object-oriented programming language.It is an expansion of the C programming language to include Object Oriented Programming(OOPs) and is used to develop programs for computers. C++ is a most popular cross-platform programming language which is used to create high-performance applications and software like OS, Games, E-commerce software, etc.

## Why Learn C++
* C++ is one of the most used and popular programming languages.
* C++ is used in making operating systems, embedded systems, and Graphical User Interfaces.
* It is an object-oriented programming language that implements all the OOPs concepts such as Abstraction, Encapsulation, and Inheritance, which gives a clear structure to * * programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs and providing security.
* It is portable and can be used to create applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
* C++ is easy to learn so that you can choose it as your first programming language.
* It makes programming easy for programmers to switch to C++ because its syntax is similar to C, Java, and C#.

#### simple C++ code examples to help you understand the language:

```c++
#include <iostream>
  
int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
